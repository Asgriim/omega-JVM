First of all, let's start with the fact that I, am really not very confident in my abilities and not sure if anyone will ever be interested in my code.
But if, by some chance, you decide to use it, maybe it will be somewhat helpful. I can't guarantee that my code works, but perhaps it does something similar to what I had in mind.

1. Usage:
   You can use my code, copy it, make changes, and do whatever you want, I guess.
   I don't even know why you would want to, but maybe you can. Just keep in mind that I can't provide any guarantees regarding its functionality.

2. Warranties:
   There are no warranties. What if it breaks something? Or maybe it doesn't do what you expect?
   I don't know, and I hope not. But I'm unlikely to be able to help you if something goes wrong.

3. Liability:
   I really don't want any liability. For anything.
   If something goes wrong, I'm sorry, but it probably isn't my fault. I did warn you that I'm not very confident.

4. Changes:
   If you want to make changes to my code, maybe it will even be better. Probably, you can do better than me anyway. But remember, it's always at your own risk.

5. Violations:
   If you still violate any rules or if something goes wrong, it might make me very upset, but I probably won't be able to do anything about it. I'll just be sad, I guess.

6. Everything else:
   Well, what else can I say? This is just a license from someone who's not very sure of themselves. Hopefully, you understand.

This is my license. It might not be very good, but it might work for those who need my code. Or maybe it's better not to touch it at all. The decision is yours.
